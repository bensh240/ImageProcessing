# ImageProcessing
This project was part of Intro to CS class at Reichman University.
In this project we were aiming to learn how to manipulate images using java.

# Project Exlaintion (seperated by modules)
This project has different modules for different goals:
  Editor 1 - Flipping an image horizontally, vertically, and greyscaling an image.
  Editor 2 - Demonstrates the scaling function of Instush.java
  Editor 3 - Demonstrates the morphing service of Instush.java
  Editor 4 - This program morphs an image into its grescaled.

# How To Run Properly?
Editor 1:
  java Editor1.java <image name> <options>
  Manipulation options:
    "fh" - Flip horizontaly
    "fv" - Flip vertically
    "gs" - Grayscaled version of image

Editor 2:
  java Editor2.java <image name> <weidth> <height>
  Manipulation options:
    weidth and height are measure by pixels, and will manipulate the source image.
  
Editor 3:
  java Editor3.java <image 1> <image 2> <steps>
  Manipulation options:
    Image 1 & Image 2 are strings, which are the names of the morphing images.
    steps - the amount of time in seconds.
    Image 1 is the source and image 2 is the target, new dimension will be based on the source image.
  
Editoer 4:
  java Editor4.java <image name> <steps>
  Manipulation options:
    steps - the amount of time in seconds.
